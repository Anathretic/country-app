# Countrypedia

## About

My second version of the app, which allows you to search for information about a country (200+ countries) and its data, such as population or currency.

## Coding & Problems

I decided to move the whole project to React, which has brought many benefits:
- Created function based on promise to get the data (less code to write),
- (MoreInfo) User can directly switch between countries using the border countries buttons,
- Improved inputs and sort countries alphabetically,
- Created dark mode based on Context,
- Changed loader,
